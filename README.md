### MusicBee. Blocking random playlist movements.ahk
The Drag&Drop feature is too sensitive on the playlist panel. I've mistakenly dragged a playlist or folder to another folder many times. This blocks accidental drag&drops. The X coordinate needs to be adjusted to suit your needs. I have a playlist on the left, and the X coordinate has been adjusted so that I can drag&drop playlists by clicking on the right side of the playlist. However, I am no longer able to drag&drop playlists on the left side of the playlist.
